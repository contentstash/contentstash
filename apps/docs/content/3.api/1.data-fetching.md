## ContentStash API

ContentStash provides a RESTful API to interact with the data. The API is designed to be simple and easy to use. It is built on top of Laravel and uses the Laravel Eloquent ORM to interact with the database.

### Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/{model}`: Get a list of items.
- `GET /api/{model}/{id}`: Get a single item.
- `POST /api/{model}`: Create a new item.
- `PUT /api/{model}/{id}`: Update an existing item.
- `DELETE /api/{model}/{id}`: Delete an item.

## Authentication

The API can be secured by using [Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/sanctum), [Laravel Passport](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/passport), or any other authentication mechanism that uses the auth feature of Laravel. This allows you to handle authentication and authorization in your application like you would with any other Laravel application.
