## Overview

An attribute type is a class that defines the behavior and properties of an attribute. It is used to define how an attribute is rendered in the ContentStash UI, how the migration is handled, how the attribute is validated, how the attribute is casted and how the matching is done.

## Attribute Type Registry

The attribute type registry is a central place to register and manage attribute types.

## Matching

The matching is done by the attribute type registry. The registry will try to match the attribute type by the `phpType` and `type` properties. If no match is found, the registry will try to match by the `phpType` property only.

## Built-in Attribute Types

ContentStash comes with a set of built-in attribute types that can be used out of the box.

- BigIntAttributeType
- BooleanAttributeType
- IntAttributeType
- JsonAttributeType
- StringAttributeType
- TextAttributeType
- TimestampAttributeType

## Custom Attribute Types

Create custom attribute types to extend the functionality of ContentStash.
