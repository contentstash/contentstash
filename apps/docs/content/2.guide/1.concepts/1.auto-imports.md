ContentStash automatically imports files like components, composables, helpers and Vue.js APIs. This is done by using [unplugin-auto-import](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-auto-import){:target="_blank"} and [unplugin-vue-components](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-vue-components){:target="_blank"} in the frontend.

## Components and composables

Components and composables are automatically imported from the `components` and `composables` directories in the frontend. This means that you can use them without importing them manually.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const myFancyComposable = useMyFancyComposable()
</script>

<template>
  <MyFancyComponent />
</template>
```

### Overwriting components and composables

If you want to overwrite a component or composable from a package or plugin, you can create a file with the same name in your `components` or `composables` directory. This file will be used instead of the one from the package or plugin.

## Helpers and Vue.js APIs

Helpers and Vue.js APIs are automatically imported. To see which parts of the Vue.js API and which helpers are imported, take a look at the `vite.config.ts` file in the `@contentstash/core` package (search for `AutoImport` and look at the `imports` property).
