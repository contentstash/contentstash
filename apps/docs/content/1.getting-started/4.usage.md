## Overview

ContentStash is a headless CMS that allows you to manage your content in a structured way. It provides a RESTful API to access your content from any frontend application. This guide focuses on how to use the dashboard to manage your content.

## Access the Dashboard

To access the dashboard, navigate to the `/dashboard` route of your app. You will be prompted to log in with your credentials. If you don't have an account, you can create one like you would do on other Laravel applications.
